Exploring special teams plays from 2018-2020 using tracking data

EDA created to either quickly answer or explore the feasablilty of a few ideas:
  - By punter: Field position generated through punting
  - By punter: Find best punter by punt down yardline (both after return and without return, also excluding penalty yards)
  - Using tracking data: find the best punts by the two-bounce delta
  - Using machine learning or neural network, create a model quantifying each punt as yards from goal line under expected
